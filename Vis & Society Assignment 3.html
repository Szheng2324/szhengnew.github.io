			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was hoping to show the population distribution between genders in a classic population pyramid. 

</li>
				<li>With a population pyramid, it is easy to see the number of people in each age and the comparison between male and female. 

</li><li>The population pyramid did a really good job showing the age distribution for each gender in a specific decade.

</li><li>It was a little difficult to see the difference between males and females.

</li>
				<li>I would like to see if I can showcase the female vs male difference in the next sketch.

</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was hoping to show the difference between males and females in each age category in two different decades. I was hoping that it would communicate that although they are very similar, females tend to live longer than males. 

</li>
				<li>It did a very good job of showing the difference between males and females like it was intended to do. However, I am afraid that people will automatically assume this chart as a population over time chart because that is what scatter plots are mainly used for.

</li>
				<li>I would like to explore how to make it obvious that the x-axis is age and not time in a clearer way. 

</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was hoping to combine the two designs from above. The barchart makes it a little easier to show that this is an age versus population chart rather than a time versus population chart. 

</li>
				<li>My intention for this chart was to create visualization that helps portray the difference in population across decades for both generations. 

</li>
				<li>It did a good job portraying 2 years with their respective population. However, similar to the first chart, this chart also struggles to portray the difference between male and female. 

</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>Looking across all my sketches, there are obvious strengths and weaknesses for each one. The first chart was very good at displaying the population distribution across the ages, and we can draw a general conclusion that there are more younger people than older people. However, we cannot really see the difference between males and females. There being two charts for each year also makes it harder to compare population across the two decades. The second chart is probably my least favorite chart. Although it shows the difference between male and female population, it is very cluttered and hard to read. I made the choice to use different patterns for male and female in an attempt to make it obvious that these are different variables. However, this made the chart very messy and hard to understand. If I were to continue to develop this graph, I would opt for color differences rather than pattern differences. The third design is my favorite and likely the one that will develop more during the next phase. Similar to the grist graph, it is very easy to change the difference in population for both genders in 1900 to 2000. However, it also shares the same problem of not being able to compare to females and males. Especially at a distance, these graphs look identical. However, I am confident that there are many adjustments that I can make to make this a better graph. The first thing I would attempt would be to put all the information on one graph so the audience could see the change in population over the years, the age distribution and the difference in male and female all at once.

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>This data set is the U.S. census for the demographic make-up of the United States. This describes the U.S. population in terms of year, sex and age group, and the total number of people in that age group. Through my visualization I am trying to display as much of this data as possible. Some of the relationships that I considered were population differences across two years, population across sexes, and how much of the total population is in a specific age group. Through my visualization, I was better at displaying some of the information more than others. In terms of displaying the population difference between two different times, I was the most successful. In this visualization, I used very distinct colors to represent the difference in years, in which I also labeled in a key at the top right corner which is a very noticeable place. Through a stacked bar graph, the audience will be able to see that the population of males of females in any age category is larger in 2000 compared to 1900. From this the audience would be easy to draw the conclusion that population has boomed in the last 100 years. With the chart, it is also easy to see how the population is distributed. Through a bar chart, a person who is reading the graph can see that in 1900 the majority of the population were gathered in the first 20 years, however, they can see that the majority of the population has extended to 40 years old by the year 2000. Not only will they be able to see the difference in population between years, they can also see how much population increased for each age category. Another reason I chose this graph was because it does not mislead the audience to think that the x -axis is different years like a scatter plot will. Instead of showing how a population has changed over time like a scatter plot, this chart will be able to show how the population is distributed through a single time. This is valuable because from the data, we don’t have a lot of data on population change through time and especially the US census only happens once every 10 years, it would be really hard to collect this data. So instead, displaying the data in a bar chart this way maximizes the information that was given in the data set. 

However, there is a major flaw in this chart. That is we cannot see the difference in population depending on gender. From the data set we can see that there is information on both male and female population distribution. However, it would be very difficult to display gender on top of population change in two decades and population distribution in the various ages without the chart becoming cluttered. So I chose to sacrifice this comparison by splitting gender into two charts because out of all of the variables, gender is the least different. Although the population can change a lot over time, the distribution of male and females tends to stay the same over time. So therefore, even if I included a visualization on the difference between male and female, they would be very similar and not informative because their similarity is already something that we are aware of. 

</p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>Surprisingly, I kept almost the same design as I had in my third sketch. I was surprised at how much more information I could put in a graph after a couple of drafts. I would say that sketching helped me alot in eliminating ineffective graphs that I was considering. For example, I had an idea in my head of building a scatter plot to show the difference in population in different age groups. When I actually drew out the chart I was surprised at how misleading it was. The lines remind me of a population over a different interval of time chart and were not very effective at showing the difference in population over time. Also during this sketch I tried to show the difference between distribution in male and females. This sketch also made me realize that their difference was not significant enough to be treated equally as some other factors. I think my sketch gave me a very solid foundation in my final version and helped me stay away from including information that was not that important and details that made the chart harder to comprehend.
